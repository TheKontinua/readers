# Only the first line without a beginning comment character #
# in this file is used to specify the server name.
# If the line is 'unknown', the name is not read from this file.
# In this case, various old server names are tried automatically.
# However, if the saver name is newer than AcroViewR15, or
# AcroViewA15, such as AcroViewR17, or AcroViewA17, explicit server
# name should be given.
# Examples of names are listed above.
# This file is effective only if it is in the same directory as that
# for the pdfdde.exe.
