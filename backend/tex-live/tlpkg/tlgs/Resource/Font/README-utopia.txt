You may freely use, modify and/or distribute this README file.

This is a copy of the Utopia Type1 fonts and accompanying AFM files
which Adobe originally contributed to the X consortium many years ago.

In 2006, Adobe relicensed them to the TeX Users Group, under similar
terms as the previous contribution, but now explicitly clarifying that
the modifications to the fonts, and redistribution of the modified
versions, was allowed.  (This was always the intent; unfortunately, the
original wording was ambiguous.)  For the actual license, please see
LICENSE-utopia.txt in this directory.  (Original url:
http://tug.org/fonts/utopia/LICENSE-utopia.txt)

The contents of the fonts themselves are completely unchanged from the
original X donation.  Additional TeX support files, and derived fonts,
are available in other TeX packages, notably fourier and mathdesign
(they are available through http://www.ctan.org).  This small directory
simply provides Adobe's original files.

The filenames here have been changed for use with TeX:
  putr8a  = Utopia-Regular 
  putri8a = Utopia-Italic
  putb8a  = Utopia-Bold
  putbi8a = Utopia-BoldItalic

These fonts are:
Copyright 1989, 1991 Adobe Systems Incorporated. All rights reserved.
Utopia(R)
Utopia is either a registered trademark or trademark of Adobe Systems
Incorporated in the United States and/or other countries. Used under
license. 

We thank Adobe for taking the time to make this clarification for the
benefit of the free software community.  Terry O'Donnell deserves
particular thanks for pushing the changes through, but many people were
involved by the end.  We are grateful to them all.
