shipped with TeX Live.  It's not intended for general use. 

Changes:

   "openjpeg", lcms2{art,mt}", and "tesseract" were removed.

 * All executable files except Ghostscript itself were removed.

 * All upp, ppd, xbm, and xpm files were removed.

 * All scripts were removed.

 * The standard fonts were replaced by the original URW Fonts
   which are used by TeX.

 * The fonts Utopia (Adobe) and Charter (Bitstream) were added.

 * A cidfmap file supporting CJK fonts provided by Windows XP and
   newer releases as well as the Japanese IPA fonts was added.

 * kanji directory copied from w32tex.

 * Binaries compiled by Akira Kakuto with --disable-compile-inits.
