# Mentoris

The Kontinua Foundation is creating a curriculum for self-paced study
of math, computer science, and physics.

The mentors for the students using this curriculum will need quizzes
(and answer keys) for each chapter. Mentoris is the web app that will
supply them with those quizzes and answer keys.

Here is our [Technical Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gqyTfjpYk12v72GUw912kEI0EFNYl_ET/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=118232505108273987896&rtpof=true&sd=true) and [Beta Site](https://calpolykontinua.gitbook.io/mentoris/)  which outlines the entire project in more detail.

## Set Up
1. Install Python 3.11 [Python Release Python 3.11.0 | Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)
2. Follow the Django installation guide: [Quick install guide | Django documentation | Django (djangoproject.com)](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/install/). We are using Django version 4.2.5
3. Install the Elastic Beanstalk CLI: Install the [EB CLI - AWS Elastic Beanstalk (amazon.com)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html)
4. Locate the config file in the `.AWS folder` (location varies based on operating system, usually in the home directory). Ask the team for the AWS Elastic Beanstalk credentials (put in "config" file) and AWS SES credentials (put in "credentials" file)
    - Run the command `eb init` in the root directory of the project
        - Select 3 `(us-west-2 : US West (Oregon))`
        - Select 1 `(mentoris)`
        - Select 1 `(Mentoris-env)`
        - Do not continue with CodeCommit
    - update the dependencies in requirements.txt (this can be done by running the command `pip freeze > requirements.txt` assuming you are working in a virtual environment with only the minimum packages installed to have Mentoris running, otherwise the dependencies need to be manually added)
    - Use the command `eb deploy` to deploy code into AWS Elastic Beanstalk  when ready
    - The current state of the project after deployment can be viewed here: [ http://mentoris-env.eba-tsm5gnpk.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/main/]( http://mentoris-env.eba-tsm5gnpk.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/main/)
    - Github: [GitHub - TheKontinua/mentoris: The web app for mentors](https://github.com/TheKontinua/mentoris)
5. Complete the official Django tutorial: [Writing your first Django app, part 1 | Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial01/)
6. Meet with the team to get tasks for your first sprint.
7. You are now ready to start writing code!
8. Pull from main on: [Kontinua Mentoris Github: GitHub - TheKontinua/mentoris: The web app for mentors](https://github.com/TheKontinua/mentoris)
9. Ask the team for the AWS RDS and SES credentials to use in settings.py
10. Perform tasks using your IDE or text editor of choice
    a. Write clean code with comments as needed
    b. Test the code before making a pull request
11. Remove the AWS RDS and SES credentials before making a pull request
12. Make a pull request and wait for it to be approved by another team member
13. Once the pull request has been merged to main the code is ready to be deployed to Elastic Beanstalk!



## Infrastructure

The web application will be open source. The primary programming
language used in this curriculum is Python, so the web app will be
written in Python using the Django web framework.

We will be using PostgreSQL as the backend database.

The questions and answers will be stored as LaTeX segments. The complete quiz will
need to be typeset using TeX. Preview will be done with LaTeX.js.

We will deploy the system on Amazon Services (RDS, SES and EB).
